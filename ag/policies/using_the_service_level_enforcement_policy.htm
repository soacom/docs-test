<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>The Service Level Enforcement Policy is a Quality of Service (QoS) policy that allows you to enable and configure the error message returned to the consumer when their SLA is violated. </p>
<p>  This policy only applies to the following Service Level rules: &quot;Usage Count,&quot; &quot;Total Request Message Size,&quot; and &quot;Total Response Message Size.&quot;</p>
<p>  The Service Level Enforcement Policy works in conjunction with a Service Level Policy. You define a Service Level Policy and specify each service level condition and alert code, then you define a Service Level Enforcement Policy and specify the error message you would like displayed when a specified service level condition is violated. </p>
<p>  When the Service Level Policy and Service Level Enforcement Policy are attached to the same Organization/Service/Contract, the messages will be rejected and returns the configured error message you defined as long as the Service Level Policy is being violated. </p>
