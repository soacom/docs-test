<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>
    <p>The Workflow states can be classified into two categories: A state that requires      immediate attention, and a state that does not.</p>
    <p>To mark a Workflow state as requiring immediate attention, you can prepend or append one or more &quot;!&quot; symbols to the name of the Workflow state (e.g., &quot;Pending Approve!!!&quot; or &quot;!Pending Approve&quot;).</p>
    <p>      When a Workflow enters a state with this special markup, it will be added into the Workflow task list so user can be immediately notified via Workbenchâ€™s Workflow task      portlet.</p>
