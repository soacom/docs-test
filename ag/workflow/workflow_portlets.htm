<h2>Introduction</h2>

      </p>
    <p>Workflow is part of the overall Governance that an organization needs to have over their SOA. </p>
    <ul class="usingOrderedList">
      <li>Workflow allows an organization to assign users to a role that provides oversight for the services that are submitted by the development community.</li>
      <li>Through the approval or rejection of service candidates, provisioning contracts, and security policies, the organization can manage the quality of the services that are published in the repository. </li>
      <li>Workflow also provides an auditable record of the submission and approval of a service which is essential for corporate compliance to processes like ISO and CMM.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Service,  Contract, and Policy Workflows that are enabled and configured with &quot;Workflow Definitions&quot; in the <em>Configure &gt; Workflow</em> section of Policy Manager, map directly to the <em>Workflow Tasks</em> <em>Portlet</em> in the Root or Sub-Organization, and to the <em>Workflow Control Portlets</em> on the Services,  Contracts, and Policies Details screens.</p>
    <p>
    <em>Note: See About Workflow for details about developing and managing Workflow definitions. </em></p>
    <h4>Global Workflow Task Portlet</h4>
    <p>In the Workflow Tasks Portlet located in the Root Organization you can globally manage urgent <em>service, contract, and policy </em>&quot;Workflow Tasks&quot; in the current organization or within the complete Organization Sub-Tree.</p>


    <h4>Workflow Control Portlet</h4>
    <p>In the &quot;Workflow Control Portlet&quot; you can manage the state of a particular service or contract.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
      <li>Service Workflow Tasks</li>
      <li>Contract Workflow Tasks</li>
      <li>Policy Workflow Tasks
       
      </li>
</ul>

<h2>Workflow Control Portlet Functionality</h2>
</a>

<p>The &quot;Workflow Control Porlet&quot; is associated with each Workbench Object (<em>service</em> or <em>contract</em>). In the Policy Manager &quot;Workbench&quot; these portlets are referred to as &quot;Service Workflow Portlet,&quot; and &quot;Contract Workflow Portlet.&quot; They provide the following functionality:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Lists all the available Workflow actions for a service or contract object.</li>
  <li>View or Modify options are permitted based on defined permissions in the &quot;Workflow Definition&quot;</li>
  <li>Provides &quot;Comment&quot; feature for commenting details of a specific action. Comment is posted to the &quot;History&quot; section of the &quot;Workflow Control Portlet&quot; after an action is submitted.  </li>
</ul>





  <a name="portlets">
<h2>Workflow Task Portlet</h2></a>

<p>The &quot;Workflow Task Portlet&quot; is located in a &quot;Workbench&quot; Organization Object and displays the Workbench actions that have executed and that are marked as needing immediate attention in the &quot;Workflow Definition.&quot; In the &quot;Root Organization&quot; or Sub-Organizations this portlet is referred to as the &quot;Workflow Tasks Portlet.</p>
<p>  This portlet provides an overview of workflow activities associated with services and provisioned contracts at the Root Organization level and Sub-Organizations. This portlet can be used by administrators who are responsible for overseeing and managing the quality of services published in the repository (i.e., Registry). After assessing the general state of Workflow Tasks at the Root Organization level, filtered tasks within each Organization can be managed in the associated Services and Contracts Folders.</p>
<p>  To view the special Workflow Tasks, you must have the &quot;Include Subtree&quot; checkbox selected in the &quot;Workflow Tasks Portlet&quot; located in the Root Organization. You can review the posted service by selecting it in the &quot;Organization Tree.&quot; To approve the pending &quot;State&quot; click the service &quot;Name.&quot;</p>
<p>  Note: The default setting for the &quot;Include Subtree&quot; option is unchecked. If your Policy Manager deployment includes a high volume of services, and your &quot;Workflow Definition&quot; includes one or more &quot;Immediate Attention&quot; entries, the &quot;Include Subtree&quot; option located in the &quot;Root Organization&quot; could introduce performance problems as all actions from every service will post to this portlet.</p>
<p>  See Special Workflow State and Workflow Task List for more information on how these actions are configured in the &quot;Workflow Definition.&quot;</p>
