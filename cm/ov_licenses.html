<h2 id="top">Licenses: Feature Overview</h2>
<p>This document provides an overview of the Licenses feature and how it can be implemented to manage API access, define different levels of access along with appropriate service level agreements, and monetize an API.</p>
<p>It includes information about the feature design, practical implementation tips, and implementation scenarios showing how this feature can be used to benefit both API owners and app developers.</p>
<p>This topic includes the following sections:</p>

<p>The platform’s Licenses feature gives you complete control over the level of access you offer for your API. The feature is designed so that you can exactly customize your access offerings, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who</strong> you share with: By using the Licenses feature in combination with the platform’s Visibility feature, you can control exactly who can see your API and request access to it. Any defined subset of your API that you designate as Private is only seen by members of groups you specifically invite.</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> you share: You can define one or more overlapping subsets of your API (individual operations or groups of operations) that you want to package separately. Operations are grouped into scopes. A license can include more than one license term, each of which can include more than one scope, so you can package subsets of your API in different ways. You can then control access to operations and also to the corresponding API documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Service</strong>: You can determine one or more levels of access you want to offer, for each subset of the API, and define QoS (Quality of Service) policies to match the API access needs of your customer base. This also facilitates monetization of your API. For example, you could offer a limited free service and package broader access for a fee.</li>
<li><strong>Granularity</strong>: You can pull together the above three components and package them in any way you wish as licenses to efficiently manage and monetize your API.</li>
</ul>
<p>By defining what you want to offer, to whom, and to what level, you can use this feature to design an API offering that suits you and your customers exactly.</p>

<a name="licenses_implementationscenarios"></a><h3>Implementation Scenarios</h3>
<p>The great flexibility of this feature gives you very fine control over your API offering. Below are some hypothetical implementation scenarios showing how you can use this feature to package your API:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ABC Payments API has many small customers and one large customer. Some operations have been added on an experimental basis at the request of the large customer. For a beta phase, the API owner wants to release the new set of operations only to the large customer. The new operations should not even be visible to other customers.
<p>The new operations are assigned to a scope, specifically for the large customer, which has a visibility setting of Private. All other operations are assigned to a second scope with a visibility of Public. Two licenses are defined. One, for the large customer, offers access to both scopes; the second, for all other customers, offers access only to the public scope. Both licenses offer the same quality of service. The API Admin creates a Private API Group and invites the large customer. The other customers, not being invited to the private group, are unaware of these new operations. The documentation is tagged with visibility tags for each license, so that the portion of your API documentation that’s visible to a specific app developer matches the developer’s visibility into your API as defined by you.</p></li>
<li>The DEF Payments API wants to offer three tiers of service: bronze, silver, and gold. Bronze service includes free access for up to 10 transactions per second, silver service offers up to 50 transactions per second for a small monthly fee, and gold service offers up to 200 transactions per second for a larger monthly fee.
<p>The Business Admin defines a single scope, All, since access will be granted to all operations. He defines three licenses&#8212;Bronze, Silver, and Gold; each has one License Term that includes the All scope and the applicable QoS policy for the tier. The API uses licenses. Privacy is not a factor; in fact, customers need to be able to see all offerings so that they can choose, therefore all scopes and licenses have a visibility setting of Public.</p></li>
