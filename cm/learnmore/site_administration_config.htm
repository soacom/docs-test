<h3>Custom Styles:</h3>


<a name="what_color_scheme_changes_are_supported_on_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>What color scheme changes are supported on my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>You can change the platform color scheme of css styles that pertain to site background color, left and top navigation, text content area, pop-up dialog elements, horizontal rules, text color of input fields, default link colors, etc. Color scheme updates are performed by updating the custom.less and parameter.css style sheets. Click here to view a sample of the  custom.less template <a href="images/customless.css">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_style_sheets_do_i_use_to_update_the_color_scheme_on_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>What style sheets do I use to update the color scheme of my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>The platform includes a custom.less style sheet template that you can download and update based on your requirements.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>All of the variables and sprite file references  in custom.less are configured with default variables that represent the look and feel of a default platform installation.</li>
  <li>All custom.less style sheet variables are commented out. For site elements you would like to customize, you must uncomment the element and customize the variables.</li>
  <li>The custom.less file also references variable in  parameters.css style sheet which  defines the standard colors for the site.</li>
  <li>Color management for icons is accomplished by modifying the Adobe illustrator side production file that includes the sprite icon files.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_lessjs_and_what_are_the_benefits"></a><h3>What is less.js and what are the benefits?</h3>
<p>The custom.less style sheet is implemented with LESS which is a dynamic stylesheet language that extends the static CSS by adding a dynamic behavior in the CSS.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>LESS.JS is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write your own styles using the LESS pre-processor language and save them in a .LESS file.</li>
  <li>LESS.JS will compile the file into pure CSS.
  LESS variables are defined with an @ sign and Variable assignment is done with a colon (:). After you update the custom.less style sheet and rebuild, the values of the variables are inserted into the output CSS document.</li>
  <li>LESS helps reduce the size of the CSS and allows you to quickly and easily make changes to the platform color scheme and sprite files by updating one custom.less file and then rebuilding the complete set of site stylesheets.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how_do_i_download_the_customless_template"></a><h3>How do I download the custom.less template?</h3>
<p>The <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em> section includes a <strong>Download</strong> button that allows you to download the custom.less template.</p>
<p>To download the custom.less template:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Styles Customization</strong> section, click <strong>Download</strong>. A download dialog box displays.</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Save File</strong> option and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
  <li>A  custom.less template will look similar to the following:   <a href="images/customless.css">custom.less sample</a></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_a_sprite"></a><h3>What is a sprite?</h3>
<p>The platform UI includes a series of standard icons that accommodate quick filters, help, menu navigation names, window titles, etc. These standard icons cannot be changed, but when a UI customization is performed the color of the icon can be changed.
</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>A sprite is a two-dimensional image  that is used to change the color of the standard  icons on the platform when a UI customization is performed.</li>
  <li>When developing your UI customization design, in addition to deciding what colors you want to use on your site, you must also decide what icons and "contrasts" are needed before moving forward with the customization tasks.
  This task should be part of your site UI design process.</li>
  <li>The platform provides a set of sprite files with the default theme. You can view how the sprite files are specified in the custom.less file. Each one is commented with " // path to the image file" and lists a URL that represents the path of the file.</li>
  <li><em>Note that sprite files should always be uploaded after you have uploaded and regenerated your style sheets. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/spriteimagefolder.jpg" width="600" height="303" alt="" /></p>
<p>Figure. Upload sprite files to \images folder via <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> (Resources &gt; File Manager)</p><br />
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_modify_sprite_colors"></a><h3>How do I modify sprite colors?</h3>
<p>During the UI design phase of your platform deployment your brand standards and colors are selected. The site includes a series of  icons. The icon design is fixed and part of the site design, but the icon color and contrast can be changed. The general process for modifying icon colors involves the following steps:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>To change icon color and contrast, a series of sprite files that define the color contrast for platform icons must be updated by modifying the   Adobe Illustrator production file provided by SOA Software.</li>
  <li>The process involves selecting the Artboard that includes the icon you want to modify, changing the icon color, and saving the Artboard to a PNG file. The PNG file(s) must then be uploaded to the /resources/theme/default/styles/images folder via <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> to be updated in your platform UI.</li>
  <li>For detailed instructions on how to modify sprite files, click <a href="images/modify_sprite_colors.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li>If you save a sprite file to filename that is not referenced in the custom.less file, edit the custom.less file and update the path  to reflect the new filename. For example, if a particular icon was gray and you wanted it changed to orange, you might save your Artwork to a new filename that reflected the color change or you could develop a naming convention using numbers, etc. The following example is an excerpt from a custom.less file that illustrates a sprite file URL reference. <br />
    <br />
    // path to the image file of 18px sprites of leftnav navigation items that reflect the current section of &quot;subject&quot; details<br />
    // @leftnav-active-icons: @icon-active-18px: url(&quot;images/sprites_18_color.png&quot;);</li>
  <li>If you updated a style sheet, use the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option to regenerate the styles before uploading any new sprite files. Note that this function rebuilds all the folders in the /resources/theme/default/styles directory. Because of this, new sprite files must be uploaded after the site styles are regenerated.</li>
  <li>If you add a new Artboard to the Adobe illustrator production file, or save an existing Artboard as a different name, you must upload the updated sprite files to platform via the <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> section and save them in the /resources/theme/default/style/images folder. This step should be performed after the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option is used.</li>
  <li>After styles are regenerated and sprite files are uploaded, clear the browser cache and refresh the screen to view the changes.</li>
  <li>For information on uploading Sprite files to the platform, see <a href="#how_do_i_upload_sprite_files_to_the_platform">How do I upload Sprite files to the platform?</a></li>

<a name="how_do_i_upload_my_customless_file_after_i_have_updated_it"></a><h3>How do I upload my custom.less file after I have updated it?</h3>
<p>The <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em> section includes a <strong>Download</strong> button that allows you to download the custom.less template.</p>
<p>To upload the custom.less template:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Styles Customization</strong> section, click <strong>Upload</strong>. A <em>File to Upload</em> dialog box displays.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Browse</strong> to target and select a file, the <strong>Upload</strong>. After the file has been successfully uploaded the &quot;Platform style sheets have been successfully regenerated using custom.less&quot; confirmation message displays. This indicates that the style sheets were automatically rebuilt when the custom.less file was uploaded. The custom.less file is uploaded to the \resources\less directory.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="After_i_update_my_customless_file_How_do_i_apply_the_changes_to_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>After I update my custom.less file, how do I apply the changes to my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>After you update your custom.less file, you can apply the changes to the platform deployment by uploading the style sheet. After the style sheet is uploaded, the site automatically rebuilds the site style sheets and the changes are reflected on the site.
 See <a href="#how_do_i_upload_my_customless_file_after_i_have_updated_it">How do I upload my custom.less file after I have updated it?</a> for more information.</p>
<p> If the style sheet and sprite file changes are not visible immediately after the style sheet rebuild process is complete, refresh the browser cache.</p>
<p><em>Note: It is recommended that you make a backup of the default custom.less file before overwriting it with your updated version.</em></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_rebuild_my_color_scheme_styles_after_i_have_uploaded_the_customless_script">
</a><h3>How do I rebuild my color scheme styles after I have uploaded the custom.less script?</h3>
<p>The <em>Administration > Config > Custom Styles</em> section includes a <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option that allows you to Initiate a rebuild of the platform style sheets. This option is primarily used when a platform update is installed that includes style sheet changes. This option is primarily used when a site update is performed where style sheet changes were made.</p>
<p>For example, if an update was applied to the site and the update included new additions to the UI that required style sheet changes; this would mean that the style sheets were not active immediately after the update was completed. In this case, the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option would complete update process by regenerating the style sheets.</p>
<p>To rebuild site style sheets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Styles Customization</strong> section, click <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong>. The rebuild process takes approximately one minute. After style sheets have been rebuilt, the  &quot;Platform style sheets have been successfully regenerated using custom.less&quot; confirmation message displays.</li>
  <li>After the style sheets are regenerated, clear the browser cache and refresh the screen to view the changes.</li>

<p>In most cases, after you regenerate styles and upload your sprite files you must clear the browser cache and refresh the screen to view the changes.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_custom_footer"></a><h3>How do I configure a custom footer?</h3>
<p>The footer customization process includes the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Footer customization is done with an HTML file that acts as a template. The HTML file is uploaded to the /resources/templates/footer with the name footer.htm.</li>
  <li>Links in the footer.htm  file can have a class attribute with values "ext" or "dialog." When a link has a class "ext," clicking on the link will open a popup window. When the link has a class "dialog," clicking on the link will open the href in a dialog window.</li>
  <li>A footer can be uploaded using the File Manager in the <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources &gt; Resources </em>section. An uploaded footer becomes effective within five minutes if the page is refreshed after five minutes.</li>
  <li>If the footer.htm file requires additional styles, you can add them to custom.less.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_custom_logo"></a><h3>How do I configure a custom logo?</h3>
<p>The process of adding a custom logo to the platform includes configuring your logo to comply with the logo file requirements (listed below), and  uploading it to the platform.</p>

<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>If you would like to assign your own custom logo name, perform the &quot;To customize your logo filename&quot; step first, then upload the logo  following the &quot;To upload your logo file&quot; step.</li>
  <li>If you will be using the default logo filename (atmologo.png), perform the &quot;To upload your logo file&quot; step only.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Logo File  Requirements</h5>
<p>Your logo must comply with the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
<li>Width should be no  more than 400px.</li>
<li>Height should be no more than 50px.</li>
<li>Background must be transparent.</li>
<li>File format should be PNG.</li>
<li>You can use the default  filename (atmologo.png) or you can customize the logo name in the custom.less style sheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>To customize your logo filename:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <em>Admin &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em>.</li>
  <li>Click  <strong>Download</strong> to download a new custom_template.less file and rename it to custom.less.</li>
  <li>Load the custom .less file into an HTML editor and change the filename for this entry: @logo-img: url(&quot;images/&lt;image_name&gt;.png&quot;); to the new logo filename.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Custom Styles</em> section, click <strong>Upload</strong> to upload the updated custom.less file. <em>Note that the upload process automatically rebuilds the style sheets (i.e., executes the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> function).</em></li>
</ol>


<p>To upload your logo file:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <em>Admin &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em> and click <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> to ensure that all the proper style folders are generated. <em>Note: If you specified a custom logo name in custom.less and already uploaded the style sheet the rebuild step is not required. </em></li>
  <li>Go to <em>Resources &gt; Resources &gt; File Manager</em> and drill down in the &quot;Theme&quot; folder until it looks like the following:<br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/file_manager_style_folder.jpg" width="426" height="299" alt="" /></li>
  <li>Click <strong>New Directory</strong> and name it &quot;images.&quot;  The screen will look like this when you are done:<br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/file_manager_images_folder.jpg" width="444" height="290" alt="" /><br /></li>
  <li>Click into the \images folder and upload your logo file. <em>Note that the logo must comply with the stated logo  requirements. </em></li>
  <li>If for some reason the new logo does not display try refreshing your browser cache and/or  go to <em>Admin &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em> and click <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h4>Logins:</h4>



<a name="how_does_login_configuration_work"></a><h3>How does login configuration work?</h3>
<p>As part of the initial platform setup, a Site Administrator installs and a series of domains that represent an enterprises login requirements for the platform:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Supported domain types for the platform login include Facebook, OpenID Identity Provider (e.g., Google), LDAP, and CA SiteMinder.</li>
  <li>The platform installation also includes a default platform domain that is automatically enabled when a new user account is created.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the login domains are installed, they must be enabled and  customized with a Target Host (virtual host name) and Logo/Avatar (Login Button), and external login screen display Mode (i.e., Popup/Main). The <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Logins</em> section includes a login management interface where Site Administrators can perform these tasks.</p>
<p>The screen is organized as follows:</p>
<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 80%;">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">Domain Type</th>
    <th width="80%">Description</th>

<a name="does_the_platform_provide_a_default_login"></a><h3>Does the platform provide a default login?</h3>
<p>When the platform is installed, a default login domain is automatically created and can be viewed and managed by the Site Administrator in the <em>Site Administration > Config > Logins</em> section.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>The default login domain is enabled by default.</li>
  <li>A new user can log in using the default login domain by clicking the <em> Login/Signup</em> on the platform Top Navigation and entering their  email and password on the default <em>Login</em> page.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_a_target_host"></a><h3>What is a Target Host?</h3>
<p>Site Administrators can specify different URLs for logging into the platform based on roles (Administrator, Developer, User, etc.), or for a Backdoor Login if one of your domain configurations is down. This is accomplished by specifying a virtual host address for each login domain referred to as a <em>Target Host</em> (e.g., &lt;role&gt;.&lt;company&gt;.com).</p>
<p>The recommended approach is to develop a login plan for each role that covers different types of login scenarios.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>For example, if your site uses CA SiteMinder exclusively for logins, and the CA SiteMinder login is down for some reason, you will need a backdoor login to investigate the problem.</li>
  <li>In this scenario you could configure the platform default login Target Host so that only the Site Administrator can log in using email and password credentials.</li>
  <li>You could also configure an alternate Facebook (using the Facebook Connector domain) or Google login (using the OpenID Relying Provider domain) and specify a Target Host for backdoor logins.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="what_login_page_integration_modes_are_supported"></a><h3>What login page integration modes are supported?</h3>
<p>The platform allows you to select how the login page associated with a domain will be integrated. The integration method is selected via the <strong>Mode</strong> option on the <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Logins</em> page for a specific domain. Two options are supported:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li><em>Popup</em>&#8212;Displays the external login page as a popup.</li>
  <li><em>Main</em>&#8212;Displays the external login page in the platform home page instead of a popup.</li>
