<a name="what_are_the_components_of_the_site_administration_section"></a><h3>What are the components of the Site Administration section?</h3>
<p>The<em> Site Administration </em> quick filter launches the <em>Site Administration</em> section. Authorized site administrators can send out invitations to others whom they would like to invite to be site admins. All site admins have the same administration privileges for the platform deployment and can configure authentication domains that can be customized and assigned to APIs that are part of the platform deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Invite Administrators</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Invite More</strong> function allows you to send invitations to individuals that you would like grant administration privileges for your API.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Existing administrators  are displayed in a summary
    listing.</li>
  <li>When an invitation is sent a request email is issued.</li>
  <li>The invitee receives an invitation request on their <em>Dashboard</em> page. If the invitee is not a platform member, they must sign up using the same email address that the invitation is addressed to in order to accept the invitation via their <em>Dashboard</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>View Administrators</strong></p>
<p>When an administrator  invitation is submitted, the username, email address, and invitation status (i.e., Email Sent, Approved, or Rejected) of the invitee is added to the <em>Site Admins
    Summary</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Manage Administrators</strong></p>
<p>Site Administrators    can  remove
  an Administrator  from the listing.</p>

<a name="what_is_the_difference_between_a_site_administrator_business_administrator_and_api_owner"></a><h3>What is the difference between a Site Administrator, Business Administrator, and API Owner?</h3>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>When your platform is initially installed, configured, and deployed a Site Administrator is created at that time. Note that the default Site Administrator role is not automatically assigned the Business Administrator role.</li>
  <li>All other user accounts created via the platform are added to the Policy Manager instance where the tenant is defined.</li>
  <li>Each user account is automatically assigned Registered Users Group and API Owner role.</li>
  <li>The Site Administrator configures the  API Owner role based on the  visibility requirements of the tenant and intended usage. For example, if the intended usage of the platform was to allow users to add an API, the API Owner role would be configured with an &quot;Add&quot; privilege. If the intended usage of the platform was to not allow users to add an API, no privileges would be configured.</li>
  <li>Site Administrators that would like to grant additional API and App management privileges to specific users can do so by sending a Business Administrator invitation via <em>Site Administration &gt; Business Adm.</em> to selected platform users. See <a href="business_administration_business_adm.htm#what_roles_can_a_business_administrator_perform">What roles can a Business Administrator perform?</a> for more information on the roles a Business Administrator can perform.</li>
  <li>Business Administrators are part of the Business Administrator group via <em>Site Administration &gt; Business Adm. </em>See <a href="business_administration_business_adm.htm#what_are_the_components_of_the_business_admin_page">What are the components of the
      Business Admin page?</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>Note that only Business Administrators can add APIs. Site Administrators are not authorized to add APIs but can manage Business Administrators.</li>
