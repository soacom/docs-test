<a name="how_do_i_collaborate_in_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I collaborate in the platform?</h3>
<p>The platform includes an <em>API Board </em>and <em>App Board</em> that can be used to promote APIs and Apps, manage issues associated with the development cycle, or enhance the visibility of topics relating to specific APIs or Apps.</p>
<p id="API_App_Talkbox"><strong>API / App Board</strong></p>

<p>API and App resources include a <em>Board</em> that includes both a <em>topic</em> board and a <em>ticket</em> management system.</p>
 <ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Developers / Team Members with access privileges to APIs or Apps can collaborate by posting a discussion topic, or can raise issues for a specific API or App by creating a ticket.</li>
<li>Comments can be posted to board items or tickets. In addition, system generated tickets are posted for activities that require a line of approval (e.g., Request API Access, Team Invite, etc.).</li>
<li>Board activity can be filtered within the respective resource.</li>
<li>Feed entries associated with discussions and tickets are posted as notifications to the <em>Dashboard</em> of participating users (see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#how_do_i_enable_or_disable_notifications">How do I enable or disable notifications</a>).</li>
<li>Boards for both API and App resources have similar functionality, a set of sort controls that are common to both resources, and custom sort controls that are unique to the ticketing and post functions.</li>
</ul>

<a name="what_are_the_differences_between_the_app_and_api_boards"></a><h3>What are the differences between the App and API Boards?</h3>
<p>At the app level (<em>My Apps &gt; App Board</em>), collaboration is made possible by inviting individuals to join your application development team. Team members can then create private discussions with other team members pertaining to Apps and the APIs an App is consuming, or create tickets pertaining to issues associated with application development.</p>
<p>At the API level (<em>My Apps &gt; Board</em>), API developers and App Team members can post discussions pertaining to a specific API, or create tickets pertaining to issues associated with API operation.</p>
