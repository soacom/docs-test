<a name="what_are_connections"></a><h3>What are Connections?</h3>
<p>A Connection is a relationship or subscription between <em>Resources</em> (API, App, Group, Contract, User) in  the system. When a Connection to a Resource is established, the Connection will appear in the appropriate collection point in for both Resources.</p>
<p>Connections are established by sending a <em>Connection Request</em>. Each Connection Request follows a specific workflow process and a series of management tools are provided to control the lifecycle of the Connection. When a user creates a Connection to a Resource, the Resource administrators are notified of the pending request, and will see the Connection in the Connections Collection for the Resource. Users will also see the Connection in their personal Connections Collection.</p>
<p>For example, if API Access is requested for one or more Apps, an entry for the API and App will appear  on the <em>API Details &gt; Apps </em> and <em>App Details &gt; APIs </em>pages. Because these activities relate to specific Users (who are also considered Resources), feed entries associated with the activities are added to the <em>Board</em> and <em>Dashboard</em> of both the API and App owner.</p>
<p>There are several types of connections:</p>

<a name="how_do_i_manage_API_connections"></a><h3>How do I manage API Connections?</h3>
<p>The<em> My APIs &gt; Apps </em>page provides a high level summary of workflow status for apps that have requested access to the current API using the <strong>API Access</strong> function.</p>
<p>Each  listing includes:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Apps&#8212;The App Name. This link clicks through to the <em>App Details</em> page.</li>
  <li>Legals&#8212;A column that indicates whether the Legal Agreements have been accepted (Check = Accepted, No Check  = No Accepted).</li>
  <li>Sandbox / Production&#8212;Represent the two environments that an API Access Request can be submitted for. Each column displays the  current status of the API Access Request and relevant management functions (e.g., Cancel, Suspect, Resume, Request Access, Switch to Production).</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table shows <em>App Status</em> and <em>App Management Tasks</em> for apps that have requested access to the current API using the<strong> API Access </strong>function:</p>
<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 80%;">

<a name="what_is_the_API_approval_process"></a><h3>What is the API approval process?</h3>
<p>When an API Access Request is submitted:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>A board entry is posted to the <em>My Apps &gt; Board </em> of the app developer making the request, a notification is posted on the API Administrator's <em>Dashboard</em> page, and the API is added to<em> My APIs &gt; Apps</em> with a &quot;Pending Approval&quot; status.</li>
  <li>The API Administrator reviews the API Access Request.</li>
  <li>If the submitted API complies with the required approval criteria, the API Administrator approves the request, the ticket is updated to an &quot;Approved&quot; status, and the table entry for the API in <em>My Apps &gt; API Name &gt; APIs</em> is updated to an &quot;Activated&quot; status.</li>
  <li>After API access is activated, you can use the API in the applicable environment.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how_do_i_update_approved_API_access_requests"></a><h3>How do I update approved API Access Requests?</h3>
<p>Existing API Access Requests cannot be modified. The following rules apply:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>If you would like to cancel an API access request, click <strong>Cancel</strong> in either the Sandbox or Production column of the APIs table. Go to <em>My Apps</em>, choose the app, and then in the left pane click <em>APIs</em>.</li>
  <li>If you would like to add a new API, use the<strong> Add a New API </strong> function via the <em>Plus Menu</em>.</li>
  <li>If you would like to temporarily suspend API access, click <strong>Cancel</strong> in either the Sandbox or Production column of the APIs table. Go to <em>My Apps</em>, choose the app, and then in the left pane click <em>APIs</em>.</li>
</ul>
