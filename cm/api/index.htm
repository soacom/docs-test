<h3><a name="gettingstarted"></a>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To get started with using the Enterprise API Platform API, follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decide which services you need to use, and which methods (operations).</li>
  <li>Make sure the platform that your app is on (for example, .NET, iOS, or Android) supports the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Cookies</li>
      <li>HTTP 1.1 protocol</li>
      <li>HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE&nbsp;operations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check whether any authentication is required. This will depend on the nature of your app. If needed, make sure you request one of the accepted types of authentication through the Enterprise API Platform user interface.<br />
  <strong>Note</strong>: If you are invoking any Enterprise API Platform operation that requires authentication, you must first invoke the login API to get the authentication token. Once you have that, you can use it to invoke the other operations. The token is only valid for 30 minutes, so the application that's invoking the Enterprise API Platform operation must renew the token, or get a new token, periodically.</li>
  <li>For each operation, refer to the documentation for detailed information about the request message format and expected response.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="usingtheapitomodify"></a>Using the API to Modify the Platform</h3>
<p>You can use the Enterprise API Platform API to help speed up tasks normally completed through the Enterprise API Platform user interface, such as setting up your apps or APIs.</p>
<p>However, if you're running the API to make changes to the Enterprise API Platform user interface it's very important that you check for successful results along the way, and that if necessary you undo actions that haven't successfully completed. You must make sure you restore the user interface to a good stable condition with regard to your data.</p>
<p>For example, when you create an app you must then also create at least one app version. Suppose you successfully create the app, but when creating the app version you forget some values in the request body and the operation fails. You now have an app without a version. If you can't successfully add the version, delete the app using the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="apps/m_apps_deleteApp.htm">DELETE&nbsp;/api/apps/{AppID}</a></span><a href="apps/m_apps_deleteApp.htm"></a> operation. Then remedy the error and try again.</p>
<p>When you're done, remember to invoke the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="login/m_login_logout.htm">POST&nbsp;/api/login/logout</a></span><a href="login/m_login_logout.htm"></a> API to log out.</p>
